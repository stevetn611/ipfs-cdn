        During its 24th close flyby of Jupiter, NASA&apos;s Juno spacecraft
        captured this view of a chaotic, stormy area of the planet&apos;s
        northern hemisphere known as a folded filamentary region. Jupiter has no
        solid surface in the same way Earth does. Data collected by Juno
        indicate that some of the giant planet&apos;s winds run deeper and last
        longer than similar atmospheric processes on Earth.

        iss061e150268 (Jan. 31, 2020) --- The Cygnus space freighter from
        Northrop Grumman is pictured departing the vicinity of the International
        Space Station after its release from the Canadarm2 robotic arm. Cygnus
        had completed an 88-day stay attached to the Unity module after
        delivering nearly 8,200 pounds of research and supplies to space station
        on Nov. 4, 2019.

      <h1>Pluto&#x2019;s Majestic Mountains, Frozen Plains and Foggy Hazes</h1>

        Just 15 minutes after its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015,
        NASA&#x2019;s New Horizons spacecraft looked back toward the sun and
        captured this near-sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice
        plains extending to Pluto&#x2019;s horizon. The smooth expanse of the
        informally named icy plain Sputnik Planum (right) is flanked to the west
        (left) by rugged mountains up to 11,000 feet (3,500 meters) high,
        including the informally named Norgay Montes in the foreground and
        Hillary Montes on the skyline. To the right, east of Sputnik, rougher
        terrain is cut by apparent glaciers. The backlighting highlights over a
        dozen layers of haze in Pluto&#x2019;s tenuous but distended atmosphere.
        The image was taken from a distance of 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers)
        to Pluto; the scene is 780 miles (1,250 kilometers) wide.
